I love playing video games, learning Dutch, travelling (bringing piles of postcards from wherever I go), and spending time with my husband and our two adorable Papillion dogs. One of them, Chantal, shares my profile pic with me. I worked in game development for many years, but at the moment I'm taking a break."
